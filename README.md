# py-maxwell-fdfd

Solving Maxwell's equations via A python implementation of the 3D curl-curl E-field equations. This code contains additional work to engineer the eignspectrum for better convergence with iterative solvers (using the Beltrami-Laplace operator) as well as preconditioners to render the system matrix symmetric
